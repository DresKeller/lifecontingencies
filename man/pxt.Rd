\title{
Functions to evaluate survival, death probabilities and deaths.
}
\description{
These functions evaluate raw survival and death probabilities between age x and x+t
}
\usage{

dxt(object, x, t)

pxt(object, x, t, fractional = "linear")

qxt(object, x, t, fractional = "linear")
}

\arguments{

  \item{object}{
	A \code{lifetable} object.
}
  \item{x}{
	Age of life \code{x}.
}
  \item{t}{
	Period until which the age shall be evaluated. Default value is 1.
}

  \item{fractional}{
	Assumptions for fractional age. One of "linear", "hyperbolic", "constant force".
}

}
\details{
	Fractional assumptions are:
		-linear: linear interpolation between consecutive ages.
		-constant force of mortality: constant force of mortality.
		-hyperbolic: Balducci assumptions. See reference book for details.
}
\value{
A numeric value representing requested probability.

\note{
Function \code{dxt} accepts also fractional value of t. Linear interpolation is used in such case. These functions are called by many other functions.
