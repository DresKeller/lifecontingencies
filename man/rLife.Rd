\title{
Function to generate random future lifetimes
}
\description{
This function returns random samples from the time until death (future lifetime) of a subject aged x. Either 
the continuous or the curtate time until death can be returned.
}
\usage{
rLife(n, object, x = 0, k=1, type = "Tx")
}

\arguments{
  \item{n}{
Number of observations
}
  \item{object}{
An object of class lifetable.
}
  \item{x}{
The attained age of subject x. Default value is 0.
}
  \item{k}{
Number of periods within the year when it is possible death to happen. Default value is 1.
}
  \item{type}{
Either "Tx" for continuous time until death or "Kx" for curtate 
}
}
\details{
Following relation holds for the future life time: \eqn{T_x=K_x+0.5}.
}
\value{
A numeric vector of n elements.

##get 20000 random future lifetimes for the Soa life table at birth

##check if the expected life at birth derived from the life table
